# SS Institution Website - Deployment Guide

## 📁 Build Output

Your website has been successfully built and exported as static files in the `out` folder.

## 🚀 Hostinger Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Access Your Hostinger Control Panel
1. Log in to your Hostinger account
2. Go to your hosting control panel (hPanel)
3. Navigate to "File Manager"

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Navigate to the `public_html` folder (or your domain's root folder)
2. Delete any existing files in the folder (if this is a new deployment)
3. Upload ALL contents from the `out` folder to your `public_html` directory

### Step 3: File Structure
After uploading, your `public_html` should contain:
```
public_html/
├── _next/           (Next.js optimized files)
├── assets/          (Your images and assets)
├── fonts/           (Font files)
├── 404/             (404 error page)
├── index.html       (Your main website)
├── 404.html         (404 error page)
├── favicon.ico      (Website icon)
└── index.txt        (Build info)
```

### Step 4: Configure Domain
1. Make sure your domain is pointing to the correct hosting account
2. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)
3. Your website should be accessible at your domain
